# E-commerce-Platform-Monolithic-to-Microservices-Micro-Frontends-
This project showcases the migration of a health e-commerce application from a traditional monolithic architecture to a microservices-based backend with micro-frontends on the UI side. The re-architecture was done to achieve better scalability, modularity, and system resilience.

🚀 Key Features

Architecture Transformation – Migrated from a monolithic React + Spring Boot setup to microservices and micro-frontends, enabling modular deployment and independent feature updates.

Asynchronous Communication – Integrated RabbitMQ for reliable message passing, improving concurrency handling and reducing response times by ~85ms on high-traffic endpoints.

Performance & Load Testing – Validated scalability and fault tolerance using JMeter, ensuring smooth performance under heavy user load.
